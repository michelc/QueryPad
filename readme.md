# QueryPad

Quick & dirty query tool with just what I need (maybe less).


## TODO

* Work on query others than "SELECT ..." !!!
* Test with Sql Server
* Close connections !!!
* Serialize connections parameters as Json
* Use Dapper NuGet
* Check connection error (sure)
* Add Sqlite support (yes?)
* Add OleDb support for Access (no?)
* Use better colors (http://clrs.cc/ = A nicer color palette for the web)
* Display results as Grid or Text (maybe)
* Replace TextBox with RichTextBox for query input (yes?)
* Handle SQL transactions (maybe)
* Etc...
